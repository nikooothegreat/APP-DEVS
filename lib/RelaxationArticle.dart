The process is repeated with successive muscle groups throughout the body until deep muscular relaxation is achieved. '

The progressive muscular relaxation technique does not require mental imagery or special equipment and the rationale for its use is understood by most patients.The following case illustrates the use of the progressive muscular relaxation technique. A 15-year-old girl undergoing chemotherapy for a lymphoma began to experience extreme anxiety each time intravenous therapy was instituted. '
                            'She described many kinesthetic sensations during these episodes which included coldness of the extremities, abdominal discomfort, "goosebumps", and tachycardia. Although she was unable to use mental imagery techniques successfully, she was very receptive to the progressive muscular relaxation technique.With sequential tensing and relaxing of various muscle groups and attention to the consequent sensations over a 15-minute period, she was able to attain astate of deep relaxation and decreased anxiety. She was able to tolerate subsequent intravenous procedures without undue anxiety while listening to a tape recording of the technique.',
